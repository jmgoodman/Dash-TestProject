# these data could stand to be smoothed for visual appeal...

# so, I could probably just use out-of-the-box smoothing routines
# ...except pandas rolling with datetime argument handles nonuniform sampling out-of-the-box too, I think?
# ehhh it's a little more complicated than that. see: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html
# just assume uniform weekly sampling and your 4-long window for it, mkay?
# the behavior of pandas.rolling is quite BAFFLING. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, it all depends on which combinations of non-numeric columns I decide to leave in or not
# the problem seems to be that it was simply never meant to be used with more than one column at once.
